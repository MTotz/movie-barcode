## Create a barcode out of your favorite video

You can create the barcode by squeezing each frame to make a single bar, or by taking each bar to be the average color of the frame it represents.
Further customizations include:
* Specifying the width of each bar (in pixels),
* Choosing to take each nth frame, or take a frame every nth second,
* Specifying a specific slice of the video you want to make into a barcode,
* Choosing to save the barcode as a PNG file.


## To-do
1. Add option for starting point for barcode
2. Add GUI
3. Add sample images to README
